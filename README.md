# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

 ## ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud is a significant problem, with billions of dollars lost each year. Machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns that are indicative of fraudulent transactions. Credit card fraud refers to the physical loss of a credit card or the loss of sensitive credit card information. Many machine learning algorithms can be used for detection. This project proposes to develop a machine-learning model to detect credit card fraud. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical credit card transactions and evaluated on a holdout dataset of unseen transactions.

## Overview

With the rapid rise in global credit card usage, ensuring customer security has become critical. In 2019, there were approximately 2.8 billion credit card users worldwide, and fraud cases have increased sharply in recent years. In the U.S. alone, credit card fraud reports rose by 44.7% in 2020.

## Project goals

The main aim of this project is the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions, as it is essential to figure out the fraudulent transactions so that customers do not get charged for the purchase of products that they did not buy. Fraudulent Credit card transactions will be detected with multiple ML techniques. Then, a comparison will be made between the outcomes and results of each method to find the best and most suited model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions; graphs and numbers will also be provided. In addition, it explores previous literature and different
techniques used to distinguish Fraud within a dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset was retrieved from an open-source website, Kaggle.com. It contains data on transactions made in 2013 by European credit card users in two days only. Thedataset consists of 31 attributes and 284,808 rows. Twenty-eight attributes are numeric variables that, due to the confidentiality and privacy of the customers, have been transformed using PCA transformation; the three remaining attributes are ”Time”, which contains the elapsed seconds between the first and other transactions
of each Attribute, ”Amount” is the amount of each transaction, and the final attribute “Class” which contains binary variableswhere “1” is a case of fraudulent transaction, and “0” is not as case of fraudulent transaction.
